title = {Cosmic-ray antinuclei as messengers of new physics: status and outlook for the new decade},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {The precise measurement of cosmic-ray antinuclei serves as an important means for identifying the nature of dark matter and other new astrophysical phenomena, and could be used with other cosmic-ray species to understand cosmic-ray production and propagation in the Galaxy. For instance, low-energy antideuterons would provide a “smoking gun” signature of dark matter annihilation or decay, essentially free of astrophysical background. Studies in recent years have emphasized that models for cosmic-ray antideuterons must be considered together with the abundant cosmic antiprotons and any potential observation of antihelium. Therefore, a second dedicated Antideuteron Workshop was organized at UCLA in March 2019, bringing together a community of theorists and experimentalists to review the status of current observations of cosmic-ray antinuclei, the theoretical work towards understanding these signatures, and the potential of upcoming measurements to illuminate ongoing controversies. This review aims to synthesize this recent work and present implications for the upcoming decade of antinuclei observations and searches. This includes discussion of a possible dark matter signature in the AMS-02 antiproton spectrum, the most recent limits from BESS Polar-II on the cosmic antideuteron flux, and reports of candidate antihelium events by AMS-02; recent collider and cosmic-ray measurements relevant for antinuclei production models; the state of cosmic-ray transport models in light of AMS-02 and Voyager data; and the prospects for upcoming experiments, such as GAPS. This provides a roadmap for progress on cosmic antinuclei signatures of dark matter in the coming years.}

abstract = {The ALICE apparatus is dedicated to the study of pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions provided by LHC. ALICE has unique particle identification (PID) capabilities among the LHC experiments exploiting different PID techniques, i.e., energy loss, time-of-flight measurements, Cherenkov and transition radiation detection, calorimetry and topological ID. The ALICE-HMPID is devoted to the identification of charged hadrons. It consists of seven identical RICH counters, with liquid C6F14 as Cherenkov radiator (n≈1.299 at λph=175nm). Photons and charged particles detection is performed by a proportional chamber, coupled with a pad segmented CsI coated photo-cathode. In pp and p–Pb events HMPID provides 3 sigmas separation for pions and kaons up to pT=3GeV/c and for protons up to pT=5GeV/c. PID is performed by means of photon emission angle measurement, a challenging task in the high multiplicity environment of the most central Pb–Pb collisions. A dedicated algorithm has been implemented to evaluate the Cherenkov angle starting from the bi-dimensional ring pattern on the photons detector, it is based on the Hough Transform Method (HTM) to separate signal from background. In this way HMPID is able to contribute to inclusive hadrons spectra measurement as well as to measurements where high purity PID is required, by means of statistical or track-by-track PID. The pattern recognition, the results from angular resolution studies and the PID strategy with HMPID are presented.}

The detector consist of a CO2-gaseous radiator, a spherical mirror system, and Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes (MAPMT) of type H12700 from Hamamatsu as photon detectors. The detector concept was verified through R&D studies and a laterally scaled prototype. The results were summarized in a TDR, in which open issues were defined concerning the readout electronics, the shielding of the magnetic stray field in the MAPMT region, the radiation hardness of the MAPMT sensors, and the mechanical holding structure of the mirror system. In this article an overview is given on the CBM RICH development with focus on those open issues.}

abstract = {AMS-02 is a high-energy particle physics magnetic spectrometer installed on the International Space Station since May 2011, and operating continuously since then. The AMS-02 Ring Imaging Čerenkov counter (RICH) is a specialised sub-detector for the precise measurement of the particle velocity β with a resolution of Δβ/β=0.7(2.4)×10−3 for helium nuclei passing through the Aerogel (NaF) radiator. From the emitted photon counting the particle absolute charge magnitude |Z| can be estimated with an uncertainty of 0.3 charge units for helium nuclei. In 5 years of operations the optical properties of the RICH had no significant degradation and the performances of the detector have been stable in time. By means of the simultaneous use of the Silicon Tracker and the RICH, AMS is able to investigate the isotopic composition of cosmic rays in the kinetic energy range from few GeV/n to ∼10GeV/n for elements with charge |Z| up to 4 with unprecedented statistics. The precise measurement of cosmic rays light nuclei isotopes ratio, such as 3He/4He and 10Be/9Be, provide important constraints to the free parameters in the models for cosmic rays propagation in our Galaxy. In particular the mass distinction between 3He and 4He needed for the measurement of the 3He/4He flux ratio is obtained by statistical methods. The excellent simulation of the AMS detector provides the precise description needed for this analysis. Moreover, the use of the geomagnetic field for selecting control samples of CRs with enhanced abundances of heavy isotopes provides an independent tool for the study of the light nuclei isotopic composition with AMS.}
